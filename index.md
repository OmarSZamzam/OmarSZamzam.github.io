## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California (USC), at the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, advised by Professor Richard Leahy.

My research primarily focuses on applying machine learning techniques—particularly generative models, computer vision, and semi-supervised learning—to medical imaging. I prioritize working on problems that require creative and critical thinking, and I value being part of a dynamic, collaborative team where the environment fosters both innovation and productivity.

## My Research

My research focuses on applying machine and deep learning techniques, particularly generative models, computer vision, and semi-supervised learning, to medical imaging. I have worked on projects ranging from positive-unlabeled (PU) learning for time series EEG data to developing diffusion models for 3D brain image synthesis and inpainting. Additionally, I have applied quantile regression for anomaly detection and image translation, as well as explored image registration techniques and image captioning using vision transformers. Currently, my work is centered on creating a multimodal foundational model to handle diverse medical data modalities for unified analysis.
